<h1>Hello World!</h1>

<p id="Introduction">
    My name is John Lincoln Jay. Welcome to my personal site! My intention is for this site to be a sort of Linkedin alternative. However, unlike Linkedin
    I have full creative control over how this site is presented and the experience users get when they visit my site. 
    I hope you enjoy! In this site you will find a few different pages; Professional Experience, General Experience, Projects, and About me. 
    Feel free to click around, this site was built for you!
